### Tasks

* Create fully configured `device_db.pyon` for Pipistrello board
* Checkout datasets and applets within the GUI, following the instructions [here](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-2/getting_started_mgmt.html#datasets)
* Test TTL outputs with oscilliscope

### Wed Oct 05

* LED and TTL outputs working on Pipistrello board
* `device_db.pyon` file partially configured
* Ran first experiment

### Mon Oct 03

* Liesure reading and studying on the [Barrett and Kok Protocol](http://journals.aps.org/pra/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevA.71.060310), along with [this paper](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/43200/Thesis%20Jacob%20Bakermans.pdf?sequence=1).

### Thu Sep 29

* ARTIQ can successfully count numbers using the experiment called `Count`, which is contained within the `simple-count.py` file.
* Learned that the experiment code can be refreshed using the command `artiq_client scan-repository` while active in the `(artiq-main)` environment

### Wed Sep 28

* ARTIQ has been futher configured. I have successfully connected to the Pipistrello, and am making progress on configuring a `device_db.pyon` file for further testing that the board is actually connected. Current issues include finding the correct RTIO channel that corresponds to the LED on the board.
* An idle kernel has been flashed on the Pipistrello, which should turn the LED on and off every half second (although not tested as the `device_db.pyon` file needs to be configured correctly).
* More conversation can be found [here](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/issues/568) from working out an issue with connecting to the FPGA board.

### Tue Sep 27

* ARTIQ and Ubuntu configured on desktop in lab. Pipistrello not yet connected.

### Mon Sep 26

* Found out that Mac does not support the flashing software for Pipistrello. Instead, the environment has been setup with Ubuntu.

### Wed Sep 21

* Setup most of the ARTIQ environment on OSX following the instructions [here](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-2/installing_from_source.html#install-from-source).
